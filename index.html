        My jorney in Web Development started with curiosity and I quickly grew into something i deep enjoy.
        step by step, i'm buiding skills in HTML, CSS, and Tailwind Css to create modern, responsive design. I believe
        that learning is continous adventure, and i'm excited to keep growing in this field.

        to become a creative developer, who can design a websites that people enjoy using.
